Power BI Credit Card Transaction Dashboard, where I developed an interactive weekly dashboard using SQL-based transaction and customer data. The goal was to provide real-time insights to help the business make faster, data-driven decisions.
I streamlined data processing to track key performance indicatorsâ€”this helped reveal that revenue increased by 28%, reaching $55 million, with $8 million coming from interest income alone. The dashboard gave a clear overview of performance trends: for instance, 93% of transactions were through Blue and Silver cards, the activation rate was 57%, the delinquency rate stood at 6.06%, and 68% of performance was concentrated in Texas, New York, and California.
